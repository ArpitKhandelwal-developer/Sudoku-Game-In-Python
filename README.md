# Sudoku-Game-In-Python

 - The goal of the Sudoku is to fill a 4 range chart (i.e. 4×4 grid) with numbers so that every segment of the row, column, and 2 range contains all the numbers between 1 and 4. The 4×4 grid will have some of the squares filled in at the beginning of the game. The player’s work is to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid using logic. The moves will be incorrect if:

Any row contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 4
Whichever column contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 4.
Any 2×2 grid contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 4.
